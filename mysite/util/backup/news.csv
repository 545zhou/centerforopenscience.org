                            scientists are asking themselves just how much of their research is valid. In the past 10 years,
                            dozens of studies in the psychology field have been retracted, and several high-profile studies
                            have not stood up to scrutiny when outside researchers tried to replicate the research.",45

                            have been verified, independently, by more than one researcher. But in practice, critics say
                            the field rarely lives up to that ideal - and the result is a psychological literature rife with
                            findings that may or may not be true, yet are generally accepted as valid.",46
