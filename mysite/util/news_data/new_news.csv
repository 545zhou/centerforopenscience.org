Among his striking discoveries was that people exposed to litter and abandoned objects are more likely to be bigoted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

But the more recent emphasis on exact replication of experiments may be misguided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

As they learn more about their disciplines, they need to be aware of the practical challenges involved in reproducing the work of others, and the importance of finding multiple sources about a topic needs to be emphasized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Through the system researchers can obtain "badges" for project pre-registration, open data, and open materials.

If a systematic campaign of replication does not lead to the same results, then either the original research is flawed (as the replicators claim) or the replications are (as many of the original researchers on priming contend).

Although Nature’s report was headlined “Disputed results a fresh blow for social psychology,” it scarcely noted that there have been some replications of experiments modelled on Dijksterhuis’s phenomenon. His finding could still turn out to be right, if weaker than first thought.

Knowledge accumulates when scientists conduct studies and share their findings with others. Sharing allows other scientists to identify flaws or ot extend the findings to get more knowledge. Given its importance, it is surprising that a large portion of scientific research is never shared at all.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Flashy research in prestigious journals later proves to be bogus. Researchers have built careers on findings that are dubious or even turn out to be fraudulent. Much of the conversation about that trend has focused on flaws in social psychology, but the problem is not confined to a single field.                                                                                                                                                                                |

                            scientists are asking themselves just how much of their research is valid. In the past 10 years,

                            In theory, new knowledge doesn’t make it into the canon until the studies that produced it
                            have been verified, independently, by more than one researcher. But in practice, critics say
                            the field rarely lives up to that ideal - and the result is a psychological literature rife with
                            findings that may or may not be true, yet are generally accepted as valid.       |

                            another a Dutch social psychologist who made up results by the bushel. Medicine, too, has
                            seen a rash of scientific foul play; perhaps most notably, the dubious idea that vaccines
                            could cause autism appears to have been a hoax perpetrated by a scientific cheat.        |

                            and Dutch social psychologist Diederik Stapel. Even researchers desensitized by scandal-fatigue
                            did a double take when the final report on Stapel’s case came out last month. The extent of his

                            psychologists, spelling out what he sees as a way to restore the credibility of priming research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

                            EconTalk host Russ Roberts about how incentives in academic life create a tension between
                            truth-seeking and professional advancement. Nosek argues that these incentives create a
                            subconscious bias toward making research decisions in favor of novel results that may not be
                            true, particularly in empirical and experimental work in the social sciences.                           |

                            to have their work replicated for a fee. They would accept the risk of failure but also have a
                            shot at quick validation. The Reproducibility Initiative, launched earlier this month, invites
                            biomedical scientists to submit critical experiments to an advisory board, which matches those
                            experiments with a research facility equipped to repeat them.                         |

                            was in trouble came, ironically, from a study about premonition. Daryl Bem, a social psychologist
                            at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, showed student volunteers 48 words and then abruptly
                            asked them to write down as many as they could remember.                                                                                                                                                          |

                            nervous-particularly if you’re a psychologist who published an article in 2008 in any of these
                            three journals: Psychological Science, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, or
                            the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition.                                                                                                                                          |

                            that too heavily favors new and counterintuitive ideas over the confirmation of existing results
                            has led to too many findings that are striking for their novelty and published in respected
                            journals-but are nonetheless false.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
