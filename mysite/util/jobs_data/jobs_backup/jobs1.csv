<p>We are much more concerned about collaboration, passion, and ability than the actual technologies you use. We believe that a great developer should be a great developer in any language. We focus on Python in that Python developers typically value readability and community, and we are missioned with connecting and educating the open science and open source communities. The Python community represents what an effective community should look like and has strong ties to the sciences. As long as your values are aligned with those, we want to hear from you.</p>
